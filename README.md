# FilmsLibrary
Film library is a pet-project app and that work with the Tmdb-api. Here I test some interesting things for me and try to do as like me ^_^

What the next?
* jetpack compose
* flow (after coroutines)
* pagination
* more modules
* add tests
* add a detail screen for a movie
* show rating of film and other informations
* (maybe) change Retrofit to Ktorfit
* (maybe) kotlin multiplatform

Done:
* add network error processing
* Replacement Rx on coroutines
* add the app icon
* a tab was added where I trained how to create custom views.
* top and pop as pages
* paginations for top and pop
* a bottomsheet instead an activity
* separate top and pop movies in database
* Livedata
* RxJava
* try MotionLayout
* bottom navigation
* add animations
