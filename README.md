# FilmsLibrary
Film library is a pet-project app and that work with the Tmdb-api. Here I test some interesting things for me and try to do as like me ^_^

What the next?
* add error processing
* add splash screen and the app icon
* add tests
* add pagination
* add animations
* add paginations
* add a detail screen for a movie

Done:
* a tab was added where I trained how to create custom views.
* paging for top and pop
* a bottomsheet instead an activity
* separate top and pop movies in database
* Livedata
* RxJava
* try MotionLayout
* bottom navigation
